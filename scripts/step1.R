# NOTE: PART 0: Summaries before figures
# How can we quickly inspect key information from our data using dplyr?

# QUESTION:
# 0. How many unique words are there in this lexical decision task? Are they balanced across the age groups?
# 1. What are the mean, standard deviation and standard error of RTlexdec?
# 2. How do these values vary by the age of each participant?
# 3. What word has the fastest reaction time on average? How about the slowest?
# 4. What are the top three most familiar nouns and verbs?

# ANSWERS:

# QUESTION: Download danish.csv and explore the data visually
# 1. What do you think the research question is here?
# 2. Create some summaries using dplyr verb functions.
# 3. What layers could you combine in a figure here?
# 4. How do you order categories along the x-axis based on their y values?
# 5. Can you show both the standard error AND the confidence intervals for each category?
